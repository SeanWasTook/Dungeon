# Dungeon

A work in progress plugin that creates a randomly generated dungeon for the player to explore, and fills it with custom loot and monsters.

Useful Commands:

- /gear
  - Gives you basic starter gear
- /build \<region\>
  - Generates a specific portion of the dungeon. Options for regions are currently Brick, Crypt, and Mine
  - Also try "/build data" for some debug info
- /clear \<region\>
  - Destroys a section of dungeon. Options are the same as for /build, except for data
